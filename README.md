Website to post student leasing around the Georgia Tech campus.

I used the MERN tech stack to build this web application from scratch.
For my database I used MongoDB and it stores all important user information. I also used firebase for the storing images.

For my front end I used React(.js) a JavaScript framework which helped me build complex interfaces and connect components to back-end data, and render them as HTML.

For my backend I used Express(.js) and Node(.js) as my server-side framework becasue it has powerful models for URL routing and handling HTTP requests and responses.
